This file must be installed and uninstalled with the NuGet package.
Kentico will look for this file to signal whether or not the module
is supposed to be installed.
If it finds it at ~\App_Data\CMSModules\CMSInstallation\Packages\ it
will keep the module installed.
But when the NuGet package is uninstalled, this file is removed, and
Kentico also finds the same metadata file at 
~\App_Data\CMSModules\CMSInstallation\Packages\Installed\
Kentico will uninstall the Kentico database objects related to this module.

The custom module code is going to overwrite this file after it is deployed
with NuGet, because the module is going to ensure it is not accidentally uninstalled
when this file is missing (perhaps its accidentally excluded from a deployment).
Therefore, it might as well write the expected contents, including the correct
module version number.

Whent the NuGet package is built, a variable will be used to add the
version number to the name of this file (e.g. KenticoCommunity.ContentReferenceUi_1.0.0.13.xml.
This naming convestion is required by Kentico.

Below is an example of what the module metadata will look like after
the module code writes to this file.
-->
<moduleInstallationMetaData xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">
  <name>KenticoCommunity.ContentReferenceUi</name>
  <version>1.0.0.13</version>
