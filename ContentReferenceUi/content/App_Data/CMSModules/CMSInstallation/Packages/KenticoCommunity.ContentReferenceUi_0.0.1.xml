<!-- 
This file must be installed and uninstalled with the NuGet package.
Kentico will look for this file to signal whether or not the module
is supposed to be installed.
If it finds it at ~\App_Data\CMSModules\CMSInstallation\Packages\ it
will keep the module installed.
It will then copy it to ~\App_Data\CMSModules\CMSInstallation\Packages\Installed\.

But when the NuGet package is uninstalled, the original file is removed, and
Kentico will find the one copied to "Installed" 
Kentico will uninstall the Kentico database objects related to this module, and
delete the one copied to "Installed".
